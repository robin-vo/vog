\title{Unified Credibility Reserving (UCR)}
\usage{
ucr(
  triangle,
  exposure = NULL,
  F_cum = NULL,
  prior_mean = NULL,
  prior_var = NULL,
  sigma_sq = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{triangle}{A matrix representing the run-off triangle (cumulative claims)}

\item{exposure}{Vector of exposures (default: first period claims)}

\item{F_cum}{Optional vector of cumulative development proportions}

\item{prior_mean}{Optional external prior mean (mu_0)}

\item{prior_var}{Optional external prior variance (tau_0^2)}

\item{sigma_sq}{Optional process variance (default: estimated as pooled rate)}
}
\value{
An object of class "ucr" with reserve estimates and diagnostics
}
\description{
UCR is a general credibility-based reserving method that nests Chain-Ladder,
Cape Cod, and Bornhuetter-Ferguson as special cases. It adaptively estimates
credibility weights from the data using the Bühlmann-Straub framework.
