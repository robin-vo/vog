\description{
Implementation of the unified credibility framework for claims reserving.
This file contains all functions from "Classical Reserving Methods as
Credibility Estimators: A Unified Bayesian Framework" (Van Oirbeek, 2026).

The key insight is that Chain-Ladder, Cape Cod, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, and
Mack are all credibility estimators under a Poisson-Gamma-Multinomial model.
