Description: Implements a unified framework for claims reserving in non-life insurance,
    based on the insight that classical reserving methods are credibility estimators.
    Includes the Negative Binomial Chain-Ladder (NB-CL) model, Unified Credibility
    Reserving (UCR), Mack's distribution-free model, classical Bühlmann-Straub
    credibility theory, and model-agnostic predictive intervals via the
    Dirichlet-Multinomial parametric bootstrap. UCR nests Chain-Ladder,
    Bornhuetter-Ferguson, and Cape Cod as special cases with data-adaptive
    credibility weights. The multinomial bootstrap provides predictive intervals
    for any reserving method producing development proportions, governed by a
    single Dirichlet concentration parameter c that doubles as a diagnostic for
    model adequacy. Provides functions for model fitting, prediction, variance
    estimation, parametric bootstrap, diagnostics, and model comparison.
